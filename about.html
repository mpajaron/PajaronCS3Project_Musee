		<h2>PEN NAME</h2>
		<p>Mer_Holmes is my chosen pen name (real name: Mary Arn Pajaron) since it's a combination of Mer, which is the nickname that my old friends gave me, 
		and Holmes, which is the last name of my most favorite fictional character-Sherlock Holmes.
		
		The website name "Musee" is the french word for Museum which is the title of my project. I'd like to make it a museum like type of website where people
		would like to visit my artworks.</p>
		<br><br>
		<h2>WHAT GAVE ME AN IDEA TO MAKE AN ART GALLERY WEBSITE</h2>
		<p>In my facebook account, I usually like posting very random things. Sometimes, I would post my selfies or my drawings or just a couple of memes.
		At some point I cannot really choose my favorite aesthetic because I get chaotic. I thought, that maybe having a website with solely my art will make it
		very accessable for me if someone wants to see my drawings and they don't have to deal with the chaotic and random contents in my facebook acount.</p>
		<br><br>
		<h2>PERSONAL SAY ABOUT ARTS</h2>
		<p>I produce quite a lot of drawings most of the time. Most of them are posted in my account. I'm very flexible between digital and traditional type of 
		making art projects, but if asked which one i prefer more, it is traditional. I think it's because I can bring it anywhere and I like working with pencils. I don't
		really have a uniform artstyle, however, most of the time I like using junji ito or renaissance artstyle like DaVinci like sketching or painting. But I rarely do paint because paint
		is very expensive. My favorite artist/mangaka is Junji ito. Whenever I experience artblock (or artists having motivation to draw but having no idea what to
		draw in the first place) I usually draw Tomie, which is one of the characters that junji ito made in his manga. </p>
		<br><br>
		<h2>OTHER LIKES AND PERSONAL FACTS</h2>
		<p>Aside from drawing and art, my favorite hobbies are reading and watching movies. My likes are pretty much the introvert type but I do start
		building hobbies like playing badminton and volleyball with my dormer friends ever since I got in to pisay. I also love listening to music.
		I can remember how many earphones and headphones I already broke from listening to music. It might not be very common, but the music that I listen
		to is alternative rock. I personally love the bands; Arctic Monkeys, Chase Atlantic, The neighborhood, Theweeknd, Doja cat, Ariana Grande, and many more. 
		I also love watching anime especially if they are detective related plots. I do have a book or two in my shelves, but for the past year I only read one book which is 
		"Sherlock Holmes" by Arthur Conan Doyle. Someday, I would wish to read the works of Agatha Christie and Edgar Alan Poe.</p>
		<br><br>
		<h2>IS THE ARTIST FREE FOR COMMISSION?</h2>
		<p>To be honest, I have never done commissions before. At cases, poeple only consult me for drawing and would pay me something else but money because I 
		would refuse them most of the time. But I am very open for commissions and learning how commission works since it's a very great idea to use 
		my talent to earn money.</p>
